This is an example of the new streaming
library.  This allows you to print variables
and strings without having to type line after
line of Serial.print() calls.  Examples: 
A is 65.
The current date is 17-4-2009.
You can use modifiers too, for example:
A is 41 in hex. 

In library v6, you also get
Padding [**********]
Width specification [   10]
Leading zeros [04]
Format strings for stuff like dates and times 17/04/2009 08:20:03
To reduce your sketch size, these constants can be in PROGMEM
